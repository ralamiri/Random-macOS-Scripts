# README
This is a collection of bash scripts I wrote for macOS.
Most of these were made for fun, or to see if it's possible to do. 
Please read the disclaimer before running any of these commands or scripts.


**The repository is organized as follows:**

### Scripts
When executed will make changes or do something on the system.

### System Info
When executed will return specific information about the system.

### Misc.
For anything that doesn't fit in either category, mostly references and helpful standalone commands.
